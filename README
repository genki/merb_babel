merb_abel
=========

A plugin for the Merb framework that provides locales, languages, countries. (multi threaded)

In your controller add:

    before :set_locale
    

and access the user locale using  @controller.locale

If a locale is set, you can also access @controller.language and @controller.country

The locale is stored in request.env[:locale]

At the moment you have 3 ways of setting up a locale:

* default way in the config settings, overwite:

    Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_abel] = {
      :default_locale => 'en-US',
      :default_language => 'en',
      :default_country => 'US'
    }
    
* per request basis, by sending a param called locale
* store the locale in the session
